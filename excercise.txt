Copy the layouts from the pictures.
Each layout should be separate, and after you done with each layout should commit and push to github.

After you done with the layouts, make a custom FORM, with the layout of your choosing, it should use
the different css properties like: display:felx, position: absolute/relative/etc... You could look at
websites of your choosing, how a form is made, what are the questions etc.

Questions:
Please do not copy paste, answer in english and with your own words.

1. What does exactly position: absolute; do to an HTML element?



2. What is position relative?



3. What does box-sizing: border-box do to your HTML? why is it usefull?





PS: You are passing the exam only above 80%, which means you will have to retake it, which is extra work for me and also for you.
